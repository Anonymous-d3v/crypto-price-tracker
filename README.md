# crypto-price-tracker
This Python script uses the CoinGecko API to fetch real-time data for the top 10 cryptocurrencies. It captures name, symbol, price, market cap, 24h change, and volume, then saves it to a timestamped CSV using pandas. Ideal for automation, financial monitoring, or data tracking with no API key required.
